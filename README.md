In this notebook I am analyzing heart-disease dataset.

To analyze the data, we will be answering few questions - 
1. How many people have heart disease and how many people doesn't have heart disease?
2. People of which sex has most heart disease?
3. People of which sex has which type of chest pain most?
4. People with which chest pain are most pron to have heart disease?
5. Age vs Maximum heart rate when people have heart disease.
6. Age vs Maximum heart rate when people doesn't have heart disease.
7. Age vs serum cholestoral when people have heart disease.
8 Age vs serum cholestoral when people doesn't have heart disease.
9. People of which sex has more exercise induced angina?
10. Which sex of people has more fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl?
             
Conclusion

More than 45% male and 75% of female are prone to heart disease
Male has exercise induced angina more than female
Male has more fbs > 120 ml/dl than Female
